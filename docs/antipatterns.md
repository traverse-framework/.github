# Development Antipatterns

This guide collects the shortcuts and habits that make any `traverse-framework` repo harder to govern, harder to merge, or harder to trust.

These are not generic style preferences. They are the patterns most likely to create spec drift, CI failures, hidden coupling, or a confusing contributor experience — in any repo that adopts this governance model.

## 1. Writing Code Before The Governing Slice Is Clear

Antipattern:

- implementing behavior first and hoping the spec or ticket can be updated later

Why it is a problem:

- every repo here is spec-governed
- CI checks expect the PR body and changed files to align with approved spec ids
- post-hoc governance almost always produces drift or misleading PR metadata

Do instead:

- start from the approved governing spec
- if the slice truly has no missing governance work, label it `no-spec-needed`
- keep the PR `## Governing Spec` section narrow and accurate

## 2. Declaring Stale Or Extra Specs In A PR Body

Antipattern:

- copying an old PR body and leaving unrelated spec ids in place

Why it is a problem:

- `spec-alignment` validates the declared specs
- stale declarations create false governance claims and can fail CI even when the code is fine

Do instead:

- declare only the approved spec ids actually needed for the files you changed
- update the PR body after rebases or scope changes

## 3. Using `in-progress` As A Placeholder

Antipattern:

- marking a ticket `in-progress` just because it looks like the next good candidate

Why it is a problem:

- the repo's Project board status is the actionability signal
- fake `in-progress` state creates board drift and hides what is truly ready

Do instead:

- keep a ticket `Ready` until someone is actively executing it
- add a blocker note when something is blocked instead of leaving the state ambiguous

## 4. Leaving Hidden Placeholder Paths In Docs

Antipattern:

- letting docs imply a path is supported when it is still partial, inert, or only test scaffolding

Why it is a problem:

- developers and agents will follow the wrong path first
- this wastes time and creates incorrect assumptions about the supported surface

Do instead:

- point to the supported path explicitly
- make unsupported commands or bootstrap ideas fail loudly
- distinguish normative behavior from fixtures and examples

## 5. Depending On Internal Knowledge Instead Of Public Docs

Antipattern:

- assuming contributors will infer the right command, file, or release surface from repo familiarity

Why it is a problem:

- these repos are meant to be consumable by both humans and coding agents
- "just know where to look" is not a stable interface

Do instead:

- add docs for public entry paths
- link new docs from the README, quickstart, or getting-started flow when they matter to first-time users

## 6. Using `unwrap`, `panic!`, Or TODO-Driven Control Flow

Antipattern:

- relying on crashes, unchecked assumptions, or TODO comments in production code

Why it is a problem:

- every repo here expects predictable failure behavior and actionable error states
- panic-driven code undermines trust and makes automation harder to reason about

Do instead:

- return explicit errors
- document the failure mode
- capture follow-up work as a real issue instead of a lingering TODO comment

## 7. Sneaking In Demo-Only Hacks

Antipattern:

- adding one-off behavior that only works for an example but lives in foundation code

Why it is a problem:

- foundation code is supposed to stay portable and governed
- demo shortcuts become accidental product behavior if they survive one merge

Do instead:

- keep example-specific logic in examples, fixtures, or dedicated docs
- keep core logic generic and explainable

## 8. Treating Tests As Optional Around Core Logic

Antipattern:

- landing core runtime, registry, or contract logic without exhaustive automated validation

Why it is a problem:

- `100%` coverage is expected for core business and runtime logic
- missing tests usually mean missing determinism guarantees too

Do instead:

- add or update the tests in the same slice
- use repository checks and the coverage gate as design feedback, not as an afterthought

## 9. Opening A PR Without The Full Traceability Chain

Antipattern:

- code change without a durable issue, Project item, and PR linkage

Why it is a problem:

- the governance model depends on issue + Project item + PR traceability
- missing links make later review, release prep, and audit work harder

Do instead:

- keep every meaningful slice tied to a GitHub issue, a Project item, and a pull request

## 10. Letting "Behind Main" Sit Unresolved

Antipattern:

- waiting too long to restack a green PR after another PR merges

Why it is a problem:

- GitHub branch protection blocks merges on stale heads
- queue latency grows fast when several PRs touch the same top-level files

Do instead:

- rebase promptly when the PR becomes `BEHIND`
- rerun the checks on the updated head instead of trying to merge around branch protection

## 11. Duplicating Shared Governance Content Locally

Antipattern:

- copy-pasting the constitution, quality standards, or CI scripts from this repo into a consuming repo instead of vendoring/pointing to a pinned version

Why it is a problem:

- duplicated copies drift the moment either one is edited
- there is then no single source of truth for what the actual rule is

Do instead:

- keep a thin `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` pointer in the consuming repo naming the governance version it has adopted
- update the pin deliberately when adopting a new governance version, rather than letting content diverge silently
